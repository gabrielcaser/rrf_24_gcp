# Reproducible Research Fundamentals 2024 - R

## Steps
1. First you'll need to run the file "\Stata\Code\main.do", in order to run the two first scripts (processing and constructing);

2. After that, you can open the "\R\Code\main.R", in order to run the third script (analysis)

## Description of the scripts
- **1. Data Processing**: Learn to clean and tidy your datasets in preparation for analysis.
- **2. Data Construction**: Build indicators and variables from the processed data.
- **3. Data Analysis**: Conduct analyses using the constructed data.
- **4. Reproducibility Package**: Package all work into a reproducible format for sharing and validation.
